# üßæ Product Management REST API

This project is a *Spring Boot-based REST API* that manages product-related operations including create, read, update, and delete (CRUD). It is connected to a **CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins** and version-controlled with **GitHub**.

Developed with best practices for scalability, modularity, and real-world readiness, it is inspired by actual enterprise use cases implemented during my tenure at **TCS**.
